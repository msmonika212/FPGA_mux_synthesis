# FPGA_mux_synthesis
Realising mux circuit using lookup table in FPGA:-
In this project I have written RTL code in 5 different ways, and used systhesis in Vivado to observe the final circuit using the lookup table. Lookup table is first converted into a Boolean expression using min terms in k-map. Then this boolean expression is used to write the RTL/Verilog code.
